Real-world examples illustrate the importance of employees at every level, linking theory to practice with immediate relevancy that sparks student interest and promotes lasting engagement; coupled with expert discussion based on the authors’ significant industry experience, this approach helps students build the strong foundation and relevant skill set today’s workplace requires. Revised to reflect the current HRM landscape, this new 13th Edition features up-to-date practices and perspectives on recruitment, training, motivation, retention, safety, and the legal environment, with a strong focus on the role of HRM in supporting business strategy. End-of-chapter Workshops are designed to foster analytic, diagnostic, team-building, investigative, presentation, communication, writing, and other essential HRM skills, while chapter summaries, reviews, discussion questions, and more help reinforce new material. By merging pedagogy with practicality, this text gives students a well-rounded understanding of HRM and how it is practiced across industries today.
